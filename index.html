                  <p align="left">The culture was created by black and Latino inner-city youth trying to express themselves artistically by speaking on discrimination and the harsh conditions that plagued the South Bronx in the 1970s, according to Ibram X. Kendi, a University of Florida professor, who will teach a history of hip-hop course in Spring 2016.</p>
                  <img data-img-src="assets/images/other_images/spreadBG/hippop/bq.jpg" class="lazy rounded_border hover_effect pull-right" alt="HipHop Group">
                  <p align="left">Over 40 years later, hip-hop is one of the most influential genres of music,from emceeing, D.J.ing, fashion, dance and street art to everyday slang. Luis Caraballo-Burgos, a former UF professor who developed and instructed the course Sociology and Race in Hip-Hop, said that it’s hard to ignore the mass influence that hip-hop has sparked, especially Asian American community.</p>

                  <p align="left">A Filipino American producer, !llmind, made beats for rap stars such as Drake, Kanye West and J. Cole. Dumbfoundead is a widely respected Korean American battle emcee. MC Jin is a Chinese American rapper who once signed a major record deal with Ruff Ryders and starred in the blockbuster cult-classic “2 Fast 2 Furious.” Tyga is a half Vietnamese and Jamaican artist who has made massive club hits such as “Rack City” and “Faded” featuring Lil Wayne, and signed Cambodian Cocaine.</p>

                  <p align="left">Asian Americans have not only made a dent in rap music, but have solidified themselves in fashion as well..</p>
                  <p align="left"> Famous streetwear line Crooks & Castles, worn by the likes of Jay Z, 50 Cent and French Montana was created by Filipino friends Dennis Calvero and Emil Soriano.</p>
                  <p align="left">A Bathing Ape, which is responsible for hipsters’ favorite camo-printed                 jackets, was created by a Japanese D.J. named Nigo, and has been made popular by artists such as Pharrell Williams and A$AP Rocky. It’s difficult to find a music video without one of their clothing items being donned by a famous rap figure.</p>
                  <p align="left"><img data-img-src="assets/images/other_images/spreadBG/hippop/bw.jpg" class="lazy rounded_border hover_effect pull-left" alt="Lorem Ipsum">
                  <p align="left">The most notable Asian hip-hoppers are

                    the Jabbawockeez. Donning coke-white 

                    masks and gloves, the predominantly 

                    Filipino American clique made their fame 

                    on MTV’s “America’s Best Dance Crew” 

                    and are responsible for shining light on the 

                    dance element of the culture -- a core of 

                    the hip-hop Asian American community.</p>
                                      <p align="left">Ryan Finley, a 22-year-old avid dancer at UF, said that without hip-hop, Asian American students wouldn’t be as tight-knit as they are now.</p>

                                      <blockquote>“Dancing is like glue for everyone,” Finley said. “It helps bond our community.”</blockquote>

                                      <p align="left">He said hip-hop has not only unified

                    people of Asian descent, but has made 

                    him a better individual overall. During his 

                    late teens, there were many times when 

                    he would practice break-dancing instead 

                    of partying. Staying on his craft taught 

                    him discipline, progression and values that 

                    he wouldn’t have learned

                    introduced to dance.</p>
                    <img data-img-src="assets/images/other_images/spreadBG/hippop/DSC_3320.jpg" class="lazy rounded_border hover_effect pull-right" alt="Lorem Ipsum">

                      <p align="left">Finley’s passion led him to apply to UF 

                    after finding out there were multiple 

                    hip-hop dance groups on campus. He 

                    graduated with his bachelor’s in sociology and is currently getting his master’s in  management.</p>

                    <p align="left">“I don’t know what I would be doing

without hip-hop,” Finley said. “Probably 

living a more sheltered life -- not

developing myself more as an individual.”</p>
                <p align="left">Others shared this sentient.</p>
                <p align="left">John Ferrer, a UF health science major 

                    and vice president of Apocalypse Dance 

                    Crew, said dancing not only made him

                    more confident about expressing himself 

                    but also helped him

                    get closer with his 

                    friends and expand 

                    his social circle. </p>
                  <p align="left">
                    He heard that

                    before his time at UF, Asian American 

                    organizations weren’t as close with each 

                    other, and believes that dancing helped 

                    more students come together. During a 

                    workshop held by the Filipino Student 

                    Association, he saw active members 

                    from all different Asian American sub-
                    organizations and realized how important 

                    dancing is to not only him, but UF in 

                    general.
                  </p>
                  <p align="left">
                    “Being able to share the art with people

                    is rewarding,” Ferrer said. “If I can make 

                    people happy by dancing with them or for 

                    them, that’s what makes me happy.”
                  </p>
                  <p align="left">
                    For some Asian Americans, falling in love 

                    with hip-hop kept them away from bad 

                    environments that would have potentially 

                    endangered their future.
                  </p>
                  <p align="left">
                    Yoshiya Kushibiki, a UF geology major,

                    dance minor and president of The Hip 

                    Hop Collective, said gaining friends who 

                    shared the same love for hip-hop helped 

                    build a brotherhood-like rapport with 

                    fellow dancers who went out of their way 

                    to help him.
                  </p>
                  <p align="left">He grew up in a gang-ridden area of

                  Orlando, Florida, and getting into dance 

                  prevented him from dabbling in dangerous 

                  situations.
                  </p>
                  <img data-img-src="assets/images/other_images/spreadBG/hippop/hippop.jpg" class="lazy rounded_border hover_effect pull-left" alt="Lorem Ipsum">

                  <p align="left">“If it wasn’t for some people who I met

                  at hip-hop events, I would have walked 

                  my ass into a whole bunch of gangs, and 

                  Lord knows what would have happened,” 

                  Kushibiki said.
                  </p>
                  <p align="left">Out of all the elements of hip-hop, the 

                  Asian youth for the most part, tend to 

                  participate in the dance aspect of the 

                  culture. Kushibiki explained that dancing 

                  is simply more accessible. With graffiti, you 

                  constantly have to buy more spray paint to 

                  improve, and if you want to D.J., you have 

                  to buy expensive equipment.</p>
                  <p align="left">
                    “With dancing, you just get a pair of shoes,

                    literally, and YouTube videos,” Kushibiki 

                    said. Growing up in a single-parent household, he was only able 

                    to work with what was at his 

                    disposal.
                  </p>
                  <p align="left">
                    A lot of Asian Americans seem

                    to be in love with the music, 

                    simply because they’re able to 

                    relate to the resistance that is 

                    often preached by rap artists.
                  </p>
                  <p align="left">Caraballo-Burgos said that 

                  rap music gives the Asian 

                  Americans youth an outlet 

                  to find a sense of self while 

                  sharing their pain.</p>
                  <p align="left">
                    “It is struggle music,” that 

                    people relate to, he said. “In 

                    particular, [to] our Filipino 

                    brothers and sisters because 

                    of all the experience with 

                    colonialism.”
                  </p>
                <p align="left">
                  Asian Americans’ love for hip-
                  hop is strong, and it can be easy 

                  for them to identify with other 

                  minorities’ struggles. However most prefer to step into a

                  cypher (people dancing in a 

                  circle) than step up to the mic.

                <p align="left">
                  Although there are a few Asian

                  American emcees who get 

                  flashes of spotlight, none has 

                  broken into the mainstream 

                  and shined long enough to 

                  make a lasting mark.

                  There is simply too much

                  pressure when being a rapper, 

                  Caraballo-Burgos said. If 

                  Iggy Azalea was a dope D.J. 

                  or breakdancer, no one would 

                  question her authenticity or 

                  appreciation for the culture. 

                  If Eminem was just a graffiti 

                  writer, no one would bring up 

                  the fact that he’s a white male 

                  appropriating a culture.
                </p>
                <p align="left">
                  But the concept of cultural

                  appropriation isn’t exclusively 

                  for white artists. Korean rapper Keith Ape put 

                  out a viral song titled “It G Ma” 

                  which was based on Atlanta 

                  rapper OG Maco’s hit-anthem 

                  “U Guessed It.” Maco claimed 

                  that whether Ape realizes it 

                  or not, the Asian artist was 

                  mocking black stereotypes 

                  by wearing heavy jackets and 

                  gold grills in their music video, 

                  when Maco’s version did not 

                  show any of these items.
                </p>
                <p align="left">
                  Although the purpose is up

                  for interpretation, Caraballo-
                  Burgos said it’s difficult to 

                  prove someone’s intentions. 

                  Regardless if Ape’s aesthetic 

                  was for visual appeal or to make 

                  profit, there’s still a certain level 

                  of appreciation in order to pay 

                  homage to OG Maco.
                </p>
                <p align="left">
                  Not all black artists feel

                  the same strong sentiment 

                  about cultural appropriation. 

                  Bunduki Ramadan, aka Hip Hop Duke, is an underground

                  Sudanese American rapper 

                  from Jacksonville, Florida, 

                  who admires other races 

                  participating in hip-hop 

                  and believes Asian “b-boys” 

                  or breakdancers show real 

                  appreciation for the art.
                </p>
                <p align="left">
                  “Hip-hop has no color,” he 

                  said. “[Asians] hold up the 

                  culture to its

                  respect for that.”
                </p>
                <p align="left">
                  “It’s always beautiful when you

                  can share your culture with 

                  somebody else,” Ramadan said. 

                  “Asians go hard.”
                </p>
                <p align="left">
                  While hip-hop has its origins 

                  in the black and hispanic 

                  community, the culture is so 

                  big that it now belongs to the 

                  world, no longer occupying a 

                  single racial space. Finley, Ferrer 

                  and Kushibiki are proving

                  one dance step at a time.

                          pressures came from a culture where people 

                          of the LGBT community would be killed if

                            However, his most visible disability was that he was

                          U.S. to gain jobs and access
                          resources and found that
                          APIAs with disabilities in
                          California had an employment
                          rate of 27.4 percent, a rate
                          lower than Hispanics with
                          disabilities (38.2 percent)
                          or African Americans with
                          disabilities (31.7 percent).

                          “Individuals with disabilities
                          are not looked at as someone
                          who could be productive,”
                          Wong said.
                        </p>
                        <p align="left">
                          Wong has noticed over the
                          years, that data on Asian
                          Americans with disabilities is
                          sparse and they are considered
                          a hard-to-reach population.
                          As a result, there is little
                          research done about them
                          and few programs available to
                          them specifically.

                          For those who are unable
                          to be independent, the U.S.
                          government does provide
                          resources, but often, APIAs
                          cannot access them either
                          because of language or cultural
                          barriers, much like the Chiang
                          family’s experience. Chiang
                          also acknowledges this
                          importance and has started
                          a project called ReimAgine
                          Ability, in order to create
                          a community of people
                          who have disabilities, or are
                          family members or friends of
                          people who have disabilities,
                          especially for those from
                          cultures that might not be
                          disability-friendly.
                        </p>
                        <p align="left">
                          The site’s mission is to
                          reimagine what ability can
                          look like, which also means
                          acknowledging mental illness
                          as a component of ability, and
                          to examine the relationship
                          between culture, religion and
                          disability. Chiang wanted to
                          see if the acceptance brought
                          on by her parents’ Christianity
                          also happened in other
                          religions.
                        </p>
                        <p align="left">
                          “My parents would never have
                          accepted my brother unless
                          they were Christian,” Chiang
                          said. “I think one of the
                          biggest reasons they wanted to
                          love my brother and really see
                          him as human and treat him
                          really well was because of their
                          relationship with God.
                        </p>
                        <p align="left">
                          Chiang acknowledges the
                          huge influence her brother has
                          had on her life, and she wants
                          others to find the humanity in
                          her brother.

                        <p align="left">
                          “He deserves love like any
                          other person,” Chiang said. “In
                          some ways it’s so basic -- but
                          so radical.”

                        published multiple books regarding social

                        Padilla said that by having Asian

                        against inequality, the Asian American

                        Matter is that our society has labeled
                        the Asian American community as the
                        ‘model minority’ but by labeling the Asian

                        how the Asian American community has
                        constantly been spotlighted as the ‘ideal’
